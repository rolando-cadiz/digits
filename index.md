## Installation

First, [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Then create a database for your application.

```

$ createdb digits
Password:
$

```

third, cd into the directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```

$ npm install

```

fourth, create a `.env` file from the `sample.env`. Set the `DATABASE_URL` variable to match your PostgreSQL database that you created in the first step. See the Prisma docs [Connect your database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases/connect-your-database-typescript-postgresql). Then run the Prisma migration `npx prisma migrate dev` to set up the PostgreSQL tables.

```

$ npx prisma migrate dev
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "<your database name>", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

Applying migration `20240708195109_init`

The following migration(s) have been applied:

migrations/
â””â”€ 20240708195109_init/
â””â”€ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.

âœ” Generated Prisma Client (v5.16.1) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 51ms

$

```

Then seed the database with the `/config/settings.development.json` data using `npx prisma db seed`.

```

$ npx prisma db seed
Environment variables loaded from .env
Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed.ts` ...
Seeding the database
Creating user: admin@foo.com with role: ADMIN
Creating user: john@foo.com with role: USER

ðŸŒ± The seed command has been executed.
$

```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed and the database seeded, you can run the application by invoking the "dev" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/nextjs-application-template/blob/master/app/package.json):

```

$ npm run dev

> nextjs-application-template-1@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

â–² Next.js 14.2.4

- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

âœ“ Starting...
âœ“ Ready in 1619ms

```

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the digit application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can log in using the credentials in [settings.development.json], or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the src/ directory with:

```
$ npm run lint

> next lint

âœ” No ESLint warnings or errors
$
```

## Walkthrough

The following sections describe the major features of this app.

### Directory structure

The top-level directory structure is:

```

.github # holds the GitHub Continuous Integration action and Issue template.

config/ # holds configuration files, such as settings.development.json

doc/ # holds developer documentation, user guides, etc.

prisma/ # holds the Prisma ORM schema and seed.ts files.

public/ # holds the public images.

src/ # holds the application files.

tests/ # holds the Playwright acceptance tests.

.eslintrc.json # The ESLint configuration.

.gitignore # don't commit VSCode settings files, node_modules, and settings.production.json

```

This structure separates documentation files (such as screenshots) and configuration files (such as the settings files) from the actual Next.js application.

The src/ directory has this structure:

```

app/

  add/ # The add route
    page.tsx # The Add Contact Page

  admin/
    page.tsx # The Admin Page

  api/auth/[...nextauth]/
    route.ts # The NextAuth configuration

  auth/
    change-password/
      page.tsx # The Change Password Page

    signin/
      page.tsx # The Sign In Page

    signout/
      page.tsx # The Sign Out Page

    signup/
      page.tsx # The Sign Up / Register Page

  edit/
    page.tsx # The Edit Contact Page

  list/
    page.tsx # The List Contact Page

  not-authorized/
    page.tsx # The Not Authorized Page

  layout.tsx # The layout of the application

  page.tsx # The Landing Page

  providers.tsx # Session providers.

  components/
    AddContactForm.tsx # The React Hook Form for adding contacts.

    AddNoteForm.tsx # The React Hook Form for adding notes.

    ContactCard.tsx # Displays a card of Contact

    ContactCardAdmin.tsx # Additional information display for admin

    EditContactForm.tsx # The Edit Contact Form.

    Footer.tsx # The application footer.

    LoadingSpinner.tsx # Indicates working.

    Navbar.tsx # The application navbar.

    NoteItem.tsx # Row in the list note page.


  lib/

    dbActions.ts # Functions to manipulate the Postgres database.

    page-protections.ts # Functions to check for logged in users and their roles.

    prisma.ts # Singleton Prisma client.

    validationSchemas.ts # Yup schemas for validating forms.

  tests/ # playwright acceptance tests.

```

### Application functionality

The application implements a simple CRUD application for managing contacts, which is a PostgreSQL table consisting of a contact id (Int), first name (string), last name (string), address (string), image URL (string), description (string), notes (Note[]), and an owner (string).
By default, each user only sees the contact that they have created. However, the settings file enables you to define default accounts. If you define a user with the role "admin", then that user gets access to a special page which lists all the contacts defined by all users.
